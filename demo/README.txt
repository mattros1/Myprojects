Syllabus Reader

This is the largest project I have taken on thus far. Although it is still in its early stages, I have already achieved quite a lot. I have used pdfBox to convert a syllabus pdf into text, and have set up a Standford NLP pipeline to analyse the text using natural language processing. Additionally, I have created a class called openAiRequest, which allows me to access OpenAI through web API. This project can query OpenAI, convert pdfs to text, split the text into words/sentences, identify labels for each word using NER, and find the lemma of each word. Furthermore, I have made use of inheritance and encapsulation in the ‘sections’ folder, which stores the different sections of the syllabus
