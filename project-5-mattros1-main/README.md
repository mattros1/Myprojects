# project5 - Search engine in c.
This project is coded in C and utilizes a Hashmap to search through txt files. Currently my project is hard coded to read 3 documents, D1.txt, D2.txt,D3.txt. You can change the contents of these txt files to test. As this was a school project, there is a file called MRosica.pdf where I go more in depth into the project and a specs pdf that holds the specifications. The results of a search will print to a txt file called search_scores.txt

You can use this project using " make " , then, " ./search " ,then, "make clean" (to reset).
